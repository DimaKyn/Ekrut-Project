# Braude-MidProject

This is the final version of our mid-tohar project in Braude.
This project is the result of the work of our group, consisting of:

Rotem Levi,
Dima Kyslitzin,
Maxim Lebidinsky,
Bar Steiner,
Nastya Goldman,
Raz Weiss,
Daniel Vardimon.

This project contains two pieces of software: a server and a client (both UI applications).
The client application is a vending-machine-items store for an imaginary network ("Ekrut"), which maintains vending machines with drone-delivery capabilities.
This project also uses a database, which is contained in the ektdb.sql file.
To run this project you will need to use the MySQL Workbench (or server) to import the included .sql file (ektdb.sql), into a schema "ektdb".
